# **App Name**: ThreeJS Canvas Crafter

## Core Features:

- Modular Scene Creation: Configurable scene setup for creating various 3D environments, adhering to Single Responsibility Principle.
- 3D Component Abstraction: Abstracted component system for managing and updating 3D objects.
- Event-Driven Interactions: Centralized event handling for interactivity with 3D objects, promoting loose coupling.
- Dynamic Shape Renderer: Render 3D shapes dynamically by specifying their attributes.
- Import 3D objects: Allow importing objects into the scene using different types of file formats (e.g., glTF, OBJ).
- AI Optimizer: AI tool that optimizes the 3D model for performance based on its complexity and target platform, considering factors such as polygon count, texture size, and level of detail (LOD).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Subtle blue (#64B5F6) for a clean and modern look.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F0F2F5) for a neutral canvas.
- Accent color: Light orange (#FFCC80) to highlight interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font providing a modern and neutral aesthetic, suitable for both headers and body text.
- Use simple, outlined icons to represent scene controls and object properties.
- Clean, uncluttered layout with clear separation between the 3D canvas and control panels.
- Smooth, subtle transitions for scene changes and object interactions.
